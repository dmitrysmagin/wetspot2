                               The Crabs Return

                 The first external Wetspot 2 world, featuing
 50 brand new levels in 10 new areas, complete with a MIDI music soundtrack !

     I hope you will find these new Wetspot 2 levels both challenging and
 entertaining! You will see the crabs in completely new areas, as well as in
 places where they have been before. Two of the areas are similar to areas in
  "Crabs Revenge", the default Wetspot 2 world, but I didn't stole the ideas
 from Angelo Mottola. We made these areas in about the same time, not knowing
   about each other's work. This was quite amusing whan we found out. And I
     hope that you will find it interesting to see the differences in our
                          graphics for these areas.

    I also hope that this will inspire you enough to start making your own
       Wetspot 2 worlds. It can be quite fun, but it's also much work.
